# Dodge

A work-in-progress JavaScript game. Dodge enemies, collect boosters and earn points to upgrade your character and defeat the final boss.

## Info

I am not following a tutorial.

This program uses an HTML canvas to create the game area.

Undertaking this project is helping me to enhance my software development skills, since I am trying to adhere to best practices. For example, instead of using the class-based object-oriented approach that uses inheritance, I went for a functional approach that uses composition. This helps keep my code clean and makes it easy to create new enemies.
